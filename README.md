We shall use jupyter notebook to create a simple webpage using flask to collect user data.
Install, import and run flask,pymongo and ngrok to enable public access.
We shall configure MongoDB to enable data collection and storage of user data through the creation of our HTML form taht will collect the variables we require such as name, age, gender (drop down), expenses and total income.
An instance is created under a class using python.
We load the data from our csv file into our Jupyter Notebook and perform some visualizations to analyze income and spending.
It is observed that males spend more than females on shopping, but women spend more than men on healthcare. It would be prudent to advertise such that the males can channel their spending away from shopping towards the new healthcare product, whereas since women spend more on healthcare, the advertising would be tailored such that they are convinced that they will derive benefit from this new product in the healthcare industry without curtailing their existing expenditure on already available healthcare products.
